# MusicLoud
Web Based Audio Player

I started writing this service in 2015. Just to have fun and improve programming skills.
It's buggy and unstable but can play music. In those days I didn't know anything about composer,
containers and any build utilities. It is tested on my home server with 600 GB of music.

Today I'm going to continue making it as pet project.

## Development
To start service in development mode type:
```shell
make docker-build docker-up
```
and open in your browser url: http://localhost:8080/.

Now it requires login and password what is **guest** : **please** accordingly. It is hardcoded and will be remove in future when authentication will be done.

## Docker
Docker image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/pldin601/musicloud/).
