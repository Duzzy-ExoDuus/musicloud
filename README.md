# MusicLoud
Web Based Audio Player

I started writing this service in 2015. Just to have fun and improve programming skills.
It's buggy and unstable but can play music. In those days I didn't know anything about composer,
containers and any build utilities. It is tested on my home server with 600 GB of music.

Today I'm going to restore developing it as pet project.

## Checklist
- [x] Dockerize
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Save music to Amazon AWS
- [ ] Build frontend with webpack
- [ ] Throw out Angular and bring the React
- [ ] Authentication
